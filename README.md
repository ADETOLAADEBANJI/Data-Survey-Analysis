A DATA SURVEY ANALYSIS BREAKDOWN
- This survey aims to provide insights into the data world. The survey was taken to analyse various aspects of the data careers.
- The survey focused into getting information about the respondents with the following questions: 
- Unique ID?
- Email?
- Which title best fits your current role? 
- Did you switch careers into data? 
- Current yearly salary, what industry do you work in?
- Favorite programming language?
- How happy are you in your current position with the salary?
- How happy are you in your current position with the coworkers? 
- How happy are you in the current position with the management?
- How happy are you in your current position with learning new things?
- How difficult was it to break into tech?
- If you were to look for a new job today what would be the most important thing to you? 
- Gender?
- Current age?
-  Which country do you live in?
- Higest level of education?

  And so the answers giving to this questions by the respondents gave me an avenue to build a visualization which gives a simpler and more understandable review of the project.
